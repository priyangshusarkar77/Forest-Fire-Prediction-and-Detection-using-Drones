# Forest-Fire-Prediction-and-Detection-using-Drones
All around the globe, forests are crucial to maintaining the biosphere's integrity. 
All around the globe, forests are crucial to 
maintaining the biosphere's integrity. They 
support a diverse range of both animal and plant 
life forms and make a significant contribution to 
the global climate system. Due to the events of 
climate change, the temperature of the planet 
increased and this resulted in more frequent wild
fires. In recent days, one of the biggest forest fires 
is the Australian Bushfires which nearly burnt 
25.4 million acres (25400000 acres). This is a 
threat to humanity and if this continues then our 
food chain may collapse. There are many 
solutions for this like increasing awareness 
among the people, the intervention of the 
government to save the forest, etc. but the solution 
that we want to propose is Forest Fire prediction 
and detection using drones. The drones can 
automatically patrol those forest regions, and if 
there is any abnormal situation then the drones
will automatically alert the respective authorities 
with the information of the situation like 
coordinates, risk, etc. Using drones, patrolling 
becomes easier and with the inclusion of 
technologies like GPS, image processing and AI
prediction, the detection will be on spot.

Before predicting a forest fire, we need to know 
some terms like what is a fire and how it works, 
what are forest fires, what are weather parameters, 
etc. 
What is a Fire? Fire is the energy released in the 
form of light and heat during the process of 
combustion. Here, combustion is the process of a 
material reacting with [6] oxygen releasing energy.
Some materials (typically hydrocarbons) when they 
are heated to their ignition temperatures start 
reacting with oxygen and thus releasing energy. 
But the thing is that once the combustion started, 
the newly released energy will heat the remaining 
fuel to its ignition points and continue the 
combustion process. This is a chain reaction. For 
the fire to form it requires three elements Fuel, 
Oxygen, and Temperature. Until anyone element of 
this fire triangle depletes, the combustion process 
continues. The by-products of this combustion of 
pure fuels are CO2 + H2O. Impure fuels will result 
in pollutants like carbon monoxide, ash, etc. as byproducts.
